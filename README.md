# üßµ Textile Quality Control ‚Äì Ring Spinning Machines

## üìå Overview
In the textile industry, daily quality control requires sampling from **ring spinning machines**. Each machine may have up to **1200 spindles**, but only **48 specific samples** must be selected in sequence. Traditionally, this process is tracked manually in notebooks, which often caused **time delays** and **human errors**.

This project provides a **digital tool** to streamline the workflow, combining backend logic with a frontend dashboard. It supports **CRUD operations**‚Äîyou can **create, read, update, and delete** machine entries‚Äîmaking machine management fast and reliable.

## üîó Routes
- `/` ‚Üí Main page for sample selection and dashboard.  
- `/edit` ‚Üí Modify existing machines (last samples, date picked, nominal count of the yarn).  
- `/delete` ‚Üí Delete an existing machine.  
- `/add` ‚Üí Add a new machine.  
- `/machines` ‚Üí View all available machines and switch them on or off.  
- `/numbers` ‚Üí View all machine samples for each block.

## üí° Features
- Tracks the last sampled numbers for each machine  
- Automatically calculates the **next samples** in sequence  
- Suggests the **next machine** to sample based on the oldest last sampling  
- Allows **manual input/correction** when necessary
- REST API implemented in Flask

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer & Table Customization

The sampling tables included in this project are specific to our factory setup. 
The total spindles, block distribution, and sample positions may vary in other factories, 
even for the same machine model (e.g., Rieter G30, G35, G8).

All sampling patterns and procedures follow the **Uster Standards**, ensuring proper 
representation and consistency of yarn quality measurements.

### How the Table Keys Work
- Each key in the machine table represents a **block of 12 samples**, e.g., "13-24".  
- The keys form a **cyclic mapping** of samples:  
  - To find the samples for a given key, the system uses the **first two numbers of the previous block**, e.g., "1-12". If invalid numbers are provided, sampling starts from the first number.  
  - For the **first key**, the system uses the **first two numbers of the last key** to start the cycle.  
- This ensures that all sample numbers for a machine can be accessed in sequence **without errors**, even when the table loops.


### How to Add or Modify Machine Tables
1. Open `machines.py`.
2. Add a new dictionary for the machine model, following the existing format:
   ```python
   NEW_MACHINE = {
       "n-(n+11)": [1,13,...],
       "1-13": [sample_numbers...],
       ...
       "n-(n+11)": [sample_numbers]
   }
3. Add the new machine to `machine_dictionary`
    ```python
    machine_dictionary = {
      "previews_machine" : previous_machine,
      "NEW_MACHINE" : NEW_MACHINE
    }

## üéØ Motivation
The tool was created to solve real operational pain at work:  
- Manual tracking was **time-consuming**  
- High risk of **selecting the wrong machine** for sampling  
- Ensures **systematic, chronological selection** across multiple machines

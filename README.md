# 🧵 Textile Quality Control – Ring Spinning Machines

## 📌 Overview
In the textile industry, daily quality control requires sampling from **ring spinning machines**. Each machine may have up to **1200 spindles**, but only **48 specific samples** must be selected in sequence. Traditionally, this process is tracked manually in notebooks, which often caused **time delays** and **human errors**.

This project provides a **digital tool** to streamline the workflow, combining backend logic with a frontend dashboard.

## 💡 Features
- Tracks the last sampled numbers for each machine  
- Automatically calculates the **next samples** in sequence  
- Suggests the **next machine** to sample based on the oldest last sampling  
- Allows **manual input/correction** when necessary  
> ⚡ Can you guess what happens if you cause an Error 500?  
> Play it and find out… 😏🎮

---

## 🎯 Motivation
The tool was created to solve real operational pain at work:  
- Manual tracking was **time-consuming**  
- High risk of **selecting the wrong machine** for sampling  
- Ensures **systematic, chronological selection** across multiple machines
